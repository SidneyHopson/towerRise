# TowerRise
A game I developed starting in an Intro to Game Development course offered at my [university](https://behrend.psu.edu/). 
I continued to refine the game experience after the class ended. The project is still in the works, as I am experimenting with my capabilites within [Unreal Engine 4.](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/)

## Getting Started:
These instructions will get you a cop of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* First, install the [Epic Games Launcher](https://www.epicgames.com/unrealtournament/download)
* Next, Create an Epic Games account and login
* Finally, in the Epic Games Launcher, go to the 'Unreal Engine' tab on the left-hand side of the screen. Click the 'library' tab near the top center, and install Unreal Engine 4.22.3.

#### For Testing:
The executable is only testable on computers running Windows as their operating system. To test on other Operating Systems, download the [project files](https://github.com/SidneyHopson/towerRise/Project-Files) and package the project for MAC OS or Linux
